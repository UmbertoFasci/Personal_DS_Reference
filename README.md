### Clustering package (scipy.cluster)

Clustering algorithms are useful in information theory, target detection, communications, compression, and other areas. The`vq`module only supports vector quantization and the k-means algorithms.

The`hierarchy`module provides functions for hierarchical and agglomerative clustering. Its features include generating hierarchical clusters from distance matrices, calculating statistics on clusters, cutting linkages to generate flat clusters, and visualizing clusters with dendrograms.
